## üóíÔ∏è Notes

1. Honey Garlic Chicken Pitas 

Chicken:
‚Ä¢ 300g chicken breast, chopped
‚Ä¢ 1 tsp olive oil
‚Ä¢ 1 tbsp low sodium soy sauce
‚Ä¢ 1 tsp vinegar
‚Ä¢ squeeze of half a lemon
‚Ä¢ 1 tbsp minced garlic
‚Ä¢ 1 tsp paprika, chili powder and a crack of pepper
‚Ä¢ optional: pinch of salt (approx. 1/8 tsp)
‚Ä¢ 1 tbsp honey
-
Pita:
‚Ä¢ 1 pita, cut in halves (I used 38g whole wheat)
‚Ä¢ chopped lettuce
‚Ä¢ sliced tomatoes
‚Ä¢ sliced onions (red or white)
‚Ä¢ drizzle of yogurt (approx 2 tbsp for each pita)
-
Notes:
‚Ä¢ If you have the time, grate some lemon zest on your chicken for extra flavour.
‚Ä¢ I like to have the yogurt plain, but you can add extra ingredients to your liking such as salt, dill, lemon, garlic, etc.
‚Ä¢ When meal prepping, do NOT build the pita until eating. Simply deconstruct all ingredients in a container!
-
Yields: 2 pitas
