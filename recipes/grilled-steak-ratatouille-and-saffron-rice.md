This is an instant winner with friends. The ratatouille is full of flavour, particularly if you chargrill the courgette and aubergine sufficiently. It is also a great dish to present at a dinner party and the steak can be combined or swapped out with vegetarian options. It is full of colour and aromatic smells. 

## Ingredients

### Ratatouille
* 1 courgette, sliced
* 1 aubergine, sliced
* 2 peppers, diced
