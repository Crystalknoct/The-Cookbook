# Creamy smoked salmon pasta

Smoked salmon, one of my favourite fishes. Apparently my SO thinks I perfected this recipe. Possible thanks to my brother, who after speaking with during cooking the recipe suggested I add a couple of teaspoons of whole grain mustard.

## Ingredients

- 2 smoked salmon fillets

- Fresh parsley, finely chopped, for garnish
- Seasoning, to taste

1. Cook the pasta as per the packets instructions.
2. Cook the salmon fillets skin down until crispy.
3. In the same pan fry of the shallot and garlic.
4. Add two teaspoons of mustard.
